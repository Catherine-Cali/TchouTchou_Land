#🚆 2D Train Simulator
A web-based 2D train simulator built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to design and modify train tracks in real time, add multiple trains, and observe their behavior within defined constraints to prevent collisions and derailments.

#🎯 Features
Real-time track layout editing

Add/remove multiple trains dynamically

Basic physics to simulate movement and turning

Safety constraints to avoid derailments

User-friendly interface with interactive controls

#🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML for structure

CSS for styling

JavaScript for interactivity and logic

#📷 Preview
